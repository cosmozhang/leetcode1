#
# We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the K closest points to the
# origin (0, 0).
# 
# (Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean
# distance.)
# 
# You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be
# unique (except for the order that it is in.)
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1
# Output: [[-2,2]]
# Explanation: 
# The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
# The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
# Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
# We only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just
# [[-2,2]].
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], K = 2
# Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
# (The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.)
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= K <= points.length <= 10000
# -10000 < points[i][0] < 10000
# -10000 < points[i][1] < 10000
